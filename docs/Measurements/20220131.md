:::{admonition} Measurement type
- DFC measurements
:::

# Goal:
- Test spikiness of sensor 14
- Test new rotation matrices {RefinedAxis.txt} for the DFC approach
- Linearity test with DFC approach

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
**Setup**
- Coil 0 was energized, 27Hz, 2Vpp
- We used 1cm spacer between sensor array and calibration jig
- [Single chassis](20220117_1Chass) was used, where:
    - sensors 1,5,9 were the reference sensors
    - the remaining sensors (except for sensor 14) were treated as primary sensors

- For the linearity test with the additional coil, Tom made a large coil with two wires connected in the upper left corner, and on the lower right, and BNC connector that runs to one of the DACs on the MEG system.
- The loop of wire was about 82 cm from the center of the reference array, diameter is 73~83 cm. It seems to be a TTL level signal so 20 mA  The wires were from a standard AC power cord so you can get the diameter on-line.
- We generated a triangular signal of 0.1Hz and 2.48Vpp

**Measurements**
1. Spikiness of sensor 14: we moved one known non-spikers (sensor 15) into that slot and we saw that causes the spiking
2. Test new rotation matrices:
    - withDFC_allSens_27Hz_2Vpp_coil0_1cmSpacer_01-31-2022_raw.ds: DFC ON for all primary sensors. Sensor 14 was disabled
    - withDFC_Sens4-7-10-13_27Hz_2Vpp_coil0_1cmSpacer_01-31-2022_raw.ds: DFC ON for sensors 4,7,10,13. Sensor 14 was disabled
    - withDFC_Sens6-11-16_27Hz_2Vpp_coil0_1cmSpacer_01-31-2022_raw.ds: DFC ON for sensors 6,11,16. Sensor 14 was disabled
3. Test linearity test with additional coil (0.1Hz, 2.48Vpp, triangular wave):
    - withDFC_Sens4-7-10-13_27Hz_2Vpp_coil0_lowFreqCoil_1cmSpacer_01-31-2022_raw.ds: DFC ON for sensors 4,7,10,13. Sensor 14 was disabled
    - withDFC_allSens_27Hz_2Vpp_coil0_lowFreqCoil_1cmSpacer_01-31-2022_raw.ds: DFC ON for all primary sensors. Sensor 14 was disabled
