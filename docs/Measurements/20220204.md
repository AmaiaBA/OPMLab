:::{admonition} Measurement type
- DFC measurements
:::

# Goal:
Understand zero offsets in the beginning of DFC runs

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
The plan was to:
1. Run 30s recordings for 16 sensors in a 4x4 arrangement to see if we detect any fine zeroing offsets. We can repeat this run a few times to check whether whatever we observe is consistent over time. 27Hz on coil0 on
2. Repeat recording #1 with corner sensors only
3. Repeat recording #1 with the arrangement we used for the dfc recordings (i.e., using the reference array)
4. Repeat recording #3 with K reference placed a centimeter higher up
5. Record a 5 min long recording with DFC OFF, mu coils ON
6. Record a 5 min long recording with DFC ON (K axis positioned 1 cm higher up), with all primary sensors, and with only some of them, mu coils ON
7-8. Repeat 5,6 with mu coils OFF
9. crosstalk

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- we could only collect #1
- We ran into issues when recording #2 -- api would not recognize that any sensor was loaded when we tried to select a few sensors
- We decided to call it a day after an empty room measurement
```
- For measurement #1, we energized coil0 with 27Hz, 2Vpp
- The DFC was improved to reduce the time between fine zero, the start of the recording and the activation of coil 0
