:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Crosstalk measurements
:::

# Goal:
1. Run crosstalk measurements
2. Test chebyshev filter

# Experimenters:
Allison Nugent, Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
- We created crosstalk.py to run crosstalk for all active sensors and internal coils
**Setup**
- 2 CHASSIS were used: 0: primary sensors(1-13;15-16); 1: reference sensors (1-3)
- K reference sensor was shifted upwards by ~1cm, using a small platform made of nylon screws and cardboard



**Measurements**

1. Crosstalk
    - set_bz_coil was run as a test:
        - 1nT amplitude
        - 10Hz sine wave
        - 2s duration
    - set_bx_coil and set_by_coil were called for each sensor (3Refs, 15 primary sensors:
        - 27Hz sine wave 
        - 500pT amplitude
        - 60s each

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
we did not have time to collect bz coil data
```

2. Chebishev filter test
    - Different parameters were tested:
        - cutoff 25 Hz, db=60
        - cutoff 25 Hz, db=80
        - cutoff 22 Hz, db=80
```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- The filter gets rid of the 27Hz nicely on the K reference sensor; the I sensor is considerably reduced, too; but the J sensor has a considerable 27Hz information
- The chebyshev filter does much better than the ema filter
