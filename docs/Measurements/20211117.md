:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Fine zero variability test
:::

#### Goal: 
- Collect data to understand the variability in the coefficients derived from FieldLine's fine zeroing algorithm


#### Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez


#### Notes:
- We repeated the experiments ran at FieldLine
- We used a single sensor (sensor 10, chassis 2)
- We ran fine zeroing repeats and collected data:
    1. Mu Coils OFF, CTF electronics OFF, He level sensor OFF, Liquifier quiet mode
        - 10 FZ repeats OL 
        - 10 FZ repeats CL
        - 4 min recording in CL
    2. Mu Coils ON, CTF electronics OFF, He level sensor OFF, Liquifier quiet mode
        - 10 FZ repeats OL
        - 10 FZ repeats CL 
        - 4 min recording in CL
