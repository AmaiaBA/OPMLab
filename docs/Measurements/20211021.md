# 2021/10/21

:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration Run with OPMs
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer1cm
:::

#### Goal: 
- Repeat measurements from 2021/10/20 to understand why we see a different effect of fine zeroing w.r.t the 10/08 data

#### Experimenters: 
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

#### Setup:
- We used a 1cm spacer
- Input Voltage 5Vpp
- Otherwise, same setup as 2021/10/20

#### Notes:

- 10 repetitions of coil0 with fine zero in between, open loop
- 10 repetitions of coil0 with fine zero in between, closed loop
- 10 repetitions of coil0 without fine zero in between, open loop
- 10 repetitions of coil0 without fine zero in between, closed loop
