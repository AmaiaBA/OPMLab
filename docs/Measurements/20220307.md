- Understanding ADC channel modulation: PART 2
- Connect missing screw on chassis 1
:::

# Goal:
Understand why the ADC channel is modulated when we do rotation measurements (add link)

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez, Stephen Robinson

**SetUp**

- we used the calibrator jig, an empty primary sensor array, and the reference sensors array with 3 refs on it (so there were no primary sensors).
- the sensors belonged to chassis 1
- we connected the adc channel to chassis 1, too
- mu coils were off
Tom wrapped the calibrator cables with zipper tubing. This had no effect.

**Measurements**
- we ran 3 door open/close tests to discard whether running measurements in CL has something to do with the modulations we see in the ADC channel:
    - 03-07-2022_09-59-21_raw : 3 refs in Open Loop + ADC channel
    - 03-07-2022_10-00-54_raw: 3 refs in Closed Loop + ADC channel
    - 03-07-2022_10-02-26_raw: ADC channel only (refs OFF)

- to discard the possibility that the magnetic induction is what's causing the modulation on the adc channel, we recorded data while modulating the internal coils of the opm sensors (using the same functions as to record crosstalk)
    - we energized coil 0 with 27Hz 2Vpp while simultaneously energizing the bx, by or bz coil of the ref sensors using the api
    - the input sine wave for the internal coils was 1Hz and 10nT peak to peak
    - the duration of each measurement is 60s long
