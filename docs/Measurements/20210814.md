:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration Run with OPMs
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer2cm
:::

#### Goal: 
Run calibration measurements

#### Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd and Amaia Benitez

#### Notes:
We ran:
1. Empty room recordings (4min long, calibrator OFF) : Liquifier on
2. Coil0 recording (4min), for testing purposes : Liquifier on
3. Calibration, closed loop : Liquifier Off

    Input parameters:
    - Sine wave generator, input voltage: 2Vpp
    - Sine wave generator, frequency of sine wave: 27Hz 
    - Duration of measurement: 4 minutes per coil
    
    Setup parameters:
    - Measured 16 sensors from chassis 0, placed on 4x4 fixture, flush with its inner surface; + 3 reference sensors
    - Spacer between fixture and calibrator was 2cm
    - Airpuff tubes were placed opposite to each other to keep the bottom of the sensors cool. We alternated between them in 1 s intervals.

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- We had to reboot the chassis several times, as it kept failing during fine zeroing. Finally it was ok and we started a recording. 
- Chassis 0 shut off by itself after 4 minutes. Tom let things cool down for a minute and went through the same process, fail in fine zero, restart, fall in fine zero, restart, etc. Finally it worked ...
