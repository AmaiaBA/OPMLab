:::{admonition} Measurement type
- DFC
:::

# Goal:
1. Understand with the ADC channel fluctuates with the ambient field during rotation -- with CTF system
2. Understand polarity issues when running DFC -- with Tyler from FL

# Experimenters:
Allison Nugent, Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
**Setup**
- 3 CHASSIS were used: 0: only ADC channel (calibrator output); 1: primary sensors (all of them); 2: reference sensors (1-3)
- T connector was used for to record calibrator output by both, the CTF system and the FL system
- K reference sensor was shifted upwards by ~1cm, using a small platform made of nylon screws and cardboard
- A rotating plate was used to rotate the calibrator/sensor array (A.N. did that from inside the MSR)

**Measurements**

1. Understanding ADC fluctuations
    - Rotation tests were performed while energizing coil 0 and coil 1 (in separate runs), and with mu coils on/off
    - Function generator box inputs were as usual: 27Hz, 2Vpp
    - Only DFC ON was tested

2. Understanding polairty issues when running DFC
    - An additional rotation test was ran when Tyler from FL was online
    - We recorded a dataset while FL recorder was ran on developer mode: internal channels 38, 39 and 40 were recorded, which represent the DAQ values for bx, by, and bz coils respectively

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
We saw that bx, by get saturated when DFC corrections > 2nT were requested by adjust_fields(). Tyler suspects this is a bug
