:::{admonition} Measurement type
- DFC measurements
:::

# Goal:
- Implement DFC for primary sensors
- run DFC on/off for refs
- run DFC on/off for primary and refs
- if there is time, run linearity test

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
**Setup**
- Coil 0 was energized, 27Hz, 2Vpp
- We used 1cm spacer between sensor array and calibration jig
- Single chassis was used, where:
    - sensors 1,5,9 were the reference sensors
    - the remaining sensors (except for sensor 14) were treated as primary sensors
- Measurements were done for 300s

Sensors 1 [I], 5 [J], 9 [K] were used as ref sensors.
```

**Measurements**
- "noDFC" -- no compensation
- "withDFC_RefSens" -- only references compensated
- "withDFC_allSens" -- all sensors compensated (except 00:14, which was taking a nap)
- "withDFC_SomeSens" -- all refs and 6, 11, and 16 were compensated.


```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- Rotation matrix we used for compensating primary sensors was not correct
- We implemented the DFC for primary sensors, but compensated bz too (which we should not have)
