:::{admonition} Measurement type
- DFC measurements
:::

# Goal:
- Test DFC approach
- Enable multi-chassis measurements via the API

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd

# Notes:
- Tom made a recording with no MuCoils and lab door opening protocol
- 2 datasets were acquired:
    1. no DFC 
    2. DFC on reference sensors only

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- DFC on primary sensors did not work due to indexing issues when expanding the dfc implementation to 2 chassis
```
