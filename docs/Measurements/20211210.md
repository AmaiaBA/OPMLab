:::{admonition} Measurement type
- ADC channel variability
:::

# Goal:
The ADC channel shows substantial variability in its amplitude.
We recorded simultaneously CTF and FieldLine ADC data to understand the effect of the calibration box 

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
We collected:
- 6s per coil, for 37 coils, using the following 27Hz Vpp values: 6V, 4V, 2V, 1V, 0.5V 
- ADC for CTF was recorded, too (/eon1/data/meglab/20211210)

to do: include diagram of setup
