:::{admonition} Measurement type
- DFC measurements
:::

# Goal:
- Linearity test with DFC approach
- Test rotation matrix for primary sensor DFC

# Experimenters:
Allison Nugent, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
**Setup**
- Coil 0 was energized, 27Hz, 2Vpp
- We used NO spacer between sensor array and calibration jig
- [Single chassis](20220117_1Chass) was used, where:
    - sensors 1,5,9 were the reference sensors
    - the remaining sensors (except for sensor 14) were treated as primary sensors
- Measurements were done for 300s

**Measurements**
- 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5Vpp with DFC on references and without DFC



```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- Rotation matrix we used for linearity test was not correct. Only withDFC_refSens data is usable.
- We created a new rotation matrix and ran DFC for some primary sensors, but this rotation matrix was also incorrect
