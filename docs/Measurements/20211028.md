:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration run (coil 0 only) with OPMs
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer1cm
:::

#### Goal:
- Update firmware to v1.4.38
- Meet with Tyler to set the gains for all 4 chassis
- Collect data in CL to carry out a linearity test
- Measure crosstalk for x and y coils using api

#### Experimenters:

Stephen Robinson, Allison Nugent, Amaia Benitez

#### Notes:

**Morning session [update v1.4.38]**

- This was the setup for meeting with Tyler

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
Update with local file did not work. We power cycled, connected to the internet, and ran the update through the network. This worked well.
Tyler had issues with a few sensors: 1:12, for example, seemed to have lost the laser lock; we were not able to recover it in the morning.
Tyler was not able to set the gain for all sensors, so he only calibrated the gains for chassis 2.
```
- We collected the following data in the morning:
    - Single repetition per input Vpp for linearity test: 
        - Input voltage: 0.1Vpp,0.2Vpp,0.5Vpp, 1Vpp, 2Vpp, 5Vpp
        - Other params: 27Hz, 2min recording
        - Fine zeroing in between

    - 3 open loop runs, with 5Vpp, with fine zeroing in between
    - 5 close loop runs, with 5Vpp, with fine zeroing in between
    - 5 close loop runs, with 5Vpp, with NO fine zeroing in between 

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- The original connector between calibrator and adc channel caused strange glitches in the data. 
- Switching to a different connector removed those glitches almost entirely at input Vpp <0.5V; however, we saw many glitches at higher input voltages
```

**Afternoon session [update v1.4.39]**

- Tyler found a bug in v1.4.38
- We updated the firmware to v1.4.39 and Tyler tried to set the gains for CL

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- 2 chassis seemed to fine zero correclty together (0,1) whenever chassis 2 or 3 weren't involved.
- 4 chassis cannot find zero together. Tyler saved the log files and will try to figure out what happened
```

- We power cycled the chassis, set up calibrator and chassis 2, and collected data needed for linearity tests: 3 measurements per input voltage (0.1,0.2,0.5,1,2,5Vpp)

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
It looks like Amaia did not energize the coil for the second repetition at input voltage 0.1Vpp
```
