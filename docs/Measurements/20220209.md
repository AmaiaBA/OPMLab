- DFC measurements
:::

# Goal:
Collect MEG data from pilot participant using DFC approach

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Pilot participant: 
A.C.N.

# Notes:
**Setup**
- K reference sensor was [shifted](20220207_shiftedK) upwards by ~1cm, using a small platform made of nylon screws and cardboard
- [2 chassis](20220207_2Chass) were used: 0: primary sensors(1-13;15-16); 1: reference sensors (1-3)


**Measurements**
- We recorded 3 runs with Mu Coils ON:
    - primDFC_pilot_Clicks_good_new_raw.ds: ~420s of recording while she was listening to tone bursts  (Tom can elaborate on this). Array was placed on the left auditory cortex. DFC was ON
    - primDFC_pilot_P300_new_raw.ds: ~350s recording with an auditory oddball paradigm. Array was placed on the left auditory cortex. DFC was ON
    - primDFC_pilot_AirPuff_new_raw.ds : ~250s recording, while she received airpuff stimuli to her right XX finger (Tom/Allison, which finger was that?). The array was placed on the left somatosensory cortex. DFC was ON
- The remaining recordings were done with Mu Coils OFF:
    - primDFC_pilot_Coffee_new_raw.ds: ~240s while we recorded Allison reaching for her coffee cup and drinking from it
    - primDFC_pilot_SmallMotion_new_raw.ds: ~120s while she made small head movements like the ones shown in the video recording
    - noDFC_pilot_SmallMotion_new_raw.ds: same as the previous one, but without DFC
    - primDFC_pilot_Airpuff_SmallMotion_new_raw.ds: we repeated the airpuff experiment, but added small head movements and mu coils were OFF.
    - noDFC_pilot_Airpuff_SmallMotion_new_raw.ds: same as the previous one, but without DFC
    - primDFC_pilot_Alpha_raw.ds : ~300s recording where Allison opened and closed her eyes (this was indicated by a button press) . The array was placed on the occipital lobe
    - noDFC_pilot_Alpha_raw.ds: same as the previous one, but without DFC
