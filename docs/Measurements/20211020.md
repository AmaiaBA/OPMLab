:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration Run with OPMs
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer1cm
:::

#### Goal: 
- Set the gains for chassis 1-3 for CL (chassis 0 has a problem with the fan and will be shipped to fieldline)
- Understand the effect of fine zeroing between measurements by looking at the fine zeroing coefficients and the variability in the measured RMS of the field 


#### Experimenters: 
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

#### Setup:
- 1cm spacer between calibrator and sensor array
- Height of the sensors w.r.t the floor was ~97cm 
- Input voltage: 2Vpp

#### Notes:

**PART A: meeting with FieldLine**
- We met with Tyler at 17:15 p.m.
- First Bode plot, before gain optimization procedure

**PART B: measurements**
We ran: 
- 10 repetitions of coil0 with fine zero in between, open loop
- 10 repetitions of coil0 with fine zero in between, closed loop
- 10 repetitions of coil0 without fine zero in between, open loop
- 10 repetitions of coil0 without fine zero in between, closed loop


```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- Part A: After initial Bode plot, chassis 1 (originally chassis 2) gave us a Sensor card present/Sensor disconnected error (solid red line for all sensors). Tyler had never seen that error. We power cycled the 3 chassis and restarted them after 5min. Tyler resumed his work
- Part B: After measurement 3, Amaia accidentally restarted the sensors. Then coarse zeroed, fine zeroed and started the recoding again
```
