:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Empty Room recording
- Test filters for DFC
- Fine zeroing offsets
:::

# Goal:
1. Remove card of sensor 16, chassis 1, to send to FieldLine
1. Test the filters for DFC: ema, cheby and elliptical 
2. Collect data by fine zeroing every 2s
3. Empty room recording of all 4 chassis

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez, Stephen Robinson

# Notes:
**Setup**

1. After goal 1 was completed, Stephen placed chassis 1 on the top

```{admonition} Attention
:class: note
new chassis order is (from top to bottom): chass1-chass0-chass2-chass3 (192.168.1.43, 192.1.44, 192.168.1.40, 192.168.1.42)
```

2. For goals 2 and 3: 
    - 2 CHASSIS were used: 0: ADC channel + primaries; 1: reference sensors (1-3)
    - Array was placed on top of the calibrator jig, no spacer was used
    - K reference sensor was [shifted](20220207_shiftedK) upwards by ~1cm, using a small platform made of nylon screws and cardboard
    - All reference sensors were 'fixated' using additional tape
    - Sensor cables were wrapped gently with paper to minimize cable motion
    - Mu Coils were ON

3. For goal 4:
    - We removed the calibrator jig and placed all sensors on the plastic boxes in the middle of the room
    - Mu Coils were ON

**Measurements**

1. Test filters:
    - 180s 
    - coil 0 was energized with 27Hz sine wave, 2Vpp
    - 5 runs were collected:
        - using ema filter (tau=0.01)
        - using cheby2 filter: cutoff=22.0 order=10 dB=60
        - using ellip filter: cutoff=25.0 order=10 rp=0.1, dB=60
        - No Filter
        - No DFC (no filter)

2. Repeated fine zero measurements
    - With DFC OFF, we repeated fine zero measurements every 2s, 10 times 
    - 2 types of run were carried out:
        - 1 | were after the initial fine zeroing for all sensors, only primary sensors were fine zeroed
        - 2 | were all sensors were repeteadly fine zeroed


3. Empty room recording
    - 5 min long, with 4 chassis
