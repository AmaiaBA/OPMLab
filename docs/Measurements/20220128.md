:::{admonition} Measurement type
- DFC measurements
:::

# Goal:
- Test new rotation matrices {OPM_Axes_New.txt} for the DFC approach

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
**Setup**
- Coil 0 was energized, 27Hz, 2Vpp
- We used 1cm spacer between sensor array and calibration jig
- Single chassis was used, where:
    - sensors 1,5,9 were the reference sensors
    - the remaining sensors (except for sensor 14) were treated as primary sensors
- Measurements were done for 300s

**Measurements**
- DFC on reference sensors only
- DFC on primary sensors 6,11,16
- DFC on primary sensors 4,7,10,13 (opposite diagonal to dataset 2)
- DFC on all primary sensors


```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- Rotation matrix we used was not correct. Only the reference sensor dataset is usable
