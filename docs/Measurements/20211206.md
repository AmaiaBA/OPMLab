:::{admonition} Measurement type
- coil 0 repeatability test
- full array calibration 
:::

# Goal:
1. To understand the effect of using the multiplexer in its different modes (manual switch, programatically) on the variability of the the data across repetitions.
2. Collect a full calibration measurement using manual switches to control the calibration box

# Experimenters:
Allison Nugent, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
We collected:
- For coil 0 data:
    - 5 repetitions using switch mode
    - 5 repetitions using programable mode
    - 5 repetitions having each individual switches in switch mode and the main switch in program mode (this was a mistake)
    - for each of the modes, we collected ambient field data (no coil0 energization)

- For the calibration measurements by manually modifying the switches in the calibration box:
    - we collected 2 min per coil
    - spacer ?
