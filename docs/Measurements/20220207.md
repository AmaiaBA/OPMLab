:::{admonition} Measurement type
- DFC measurements
:::

# Goal:
Test DFC approach

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:
**Setup**
- Coil 0 was energized: 27Hz, 2Vpp
- Calibrator jig was placed using 1cm spacers 
- 2 CHASSIS were used: 0: primary sensors(1-13;15-16); 1: reference sensors (1-3)
- K reference sensor was shifted upwards by ~1cm, using a small platform made of nylon screws and cardboard

Chassis 0 [2] contains sensors 1-16; Chassis 1 [3] contains the references [1-3]

**K reference was shifted**

We used nylon screws and cardboard to create a small platform of ~1cm height.

**Measurements**
- We recorded datasets with Mu Coils turned ON and OFF
- Paradigm: opening the lab door twice (at 100s and at 200s) during the 300s recording
- We recorded data:
    - without DFC (noDFC_)
    - with DFC only applied to the sensors (refDFC_)
    - with DFC applied to all primary sensors (allSensDFC_)
    - with DFC applied to some primary sensors (someSensDFC_): 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13

    
```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- Sensor 14 (chassis 0 [2]) does not work and was disconnected
- We got a few connectivity errors when trying to restart, coarse and fine zero with the api. Doing this with FieldLine Recorder seems to work fine.
- Reference sensors were taped to the reference array
