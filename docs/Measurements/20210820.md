:::{admonition} Measurement type
Cross-talk
:::

#### Goal: 
To repeat the measurements from 2021/08/18, with correct amplitude modulation

#### Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd and Amaia Benitez

#### Notes:
- Chassis id : 0
- Input Amplitude for modulation: 2 nT
- Input Frequency for modulation: 27 Hz
- Duration of modulation: 100s


```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- Api allows for coarse/fine zero the sensors programatically, but we did not manage to make it work. We coarse/fine zeroed using the GUI
- Sensor 1 became flat when sensor 10 was modulated and remained flat for the rest of the measurements. We did not realize about it during the measurements
