- Calibration run with OPMs without multiplexer
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer1cm
- Place the AIN fins on the 4x4 grid that Catherine printed out
:::

#### Goal:
- Test effect of multiplexer on reproducibility issues
- Set up 4x4 sensor grid for thermal tests

#### Experimenters:
Stephen Robinson, Amaia Benitez


#### Notes:
**Morning:**
- Calibration measurements (coil 0)
    - 27Hz, 2Vpp, 2min recording: two types of recording
        1. We ran 5 repetitions with FZ between runs
