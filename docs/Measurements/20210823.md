:::{admonition} Measurement type
Thermal tests and cross-talk
:::

#### Goal: 
- Run Thermal test with ceramic nitride strips and heat sinks
- Cross-talk measurements for chassis 2 to ensure sensor 4 is OK
- Fix bug in real-time visualization developed by Tom

#### Experimenters:
- Thermal test: Katherine Cameron, Stephen Robinson, Amaia Benitez
- Rest: Tom Holroyd and Amaia Benitez


#### Notes:

##### Thermal test:
- We used sensors 11-16 from chassis 2, as we had 6 pairs of ceramic nitride strips
- We measured the temperature of the bottom of 3 sensors using a Thermocouple that Katherine brought

Thermal test with thermocouple. **Top**, setup consisting of 6 sensors. The strips did not fit in the fixture, so they were pasted (with thermally conductive tape) ~5mm from the bottom. **Bottom**. measured tempearture from the bottom of sensors A,B,C
```

##### Crosstalk

- Chassis id : 2
- Input Amplitude for modulation: 2 nT
- Input Frequency for modulation: 27 Hz
- Duration of modulation: 100s
- No air puff was used


- We ensured that sensor 4 in chassis 2 was flush with the inner surface of the samples
- Tom allowed for the data buffer to be larger (50 vs the 10 samples originally set), which solved the slow recording issue
