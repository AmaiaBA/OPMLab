:::{admonition} Measurement type
- DFC + Galileo somatosensory stimulation
:::

# Goal:
1. Integrate Galileo somatosensory stimulation system with the dynamic field compensation algorithm 
2. Evaluate the effect of the different filters (ema, cheby2, elliip) when running dynamic field compensation on a participant
3. Load 4x4 array model (CAD file generated by Katherine) onto BrainSight

# Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd (also pilot participant), Amaia Benitez, Anna Namyst

# Notes:
**Setup**

1. OPMs:
    - 2 CHASSIS were used: 0: ADC channel + primaries; 1: reference sensors (1-3)
    - Array was placed over the left somatosensory cortex (defined approximately based on general knowledge of experimenters)
    - K reference sensor was [shifted](20220207_shiftedK) upwards by ~1cm, using a small platform made of nylon screws and cardboard
    - All reference sensors were 'fixated' using additional tape
    - Sensor cables were wrapped gently with paper to minimize cable motion

Sensor array was placed on the left somatosensory cortex of the pilot participant. 
```


2. Galileo system:
    - TAC Cells (aka the Galileo plastic air-filled capsules) were placed on the glabrous skin of the right index, middle and ring fingertips with adhesive tape. We secured the plastic tube with additional tape
    - pneumatic pulses were simultaneous to all fingertips
    - we used biphasic pressure pulses (+127 cm/H20 to -7cm/H20) that were 100ms long, with a rise time of 11ms

3. DFC:
    - Unless stated otherwise, we used cheby2 filter, order=10, cutoff=22Hz as the filter

**Measurements**

1. DFC + Galileo system
    - ~4 minute long measurements
    - we asked the participant to stay still (noMotion runs) or to gently move their head (withMotion runs)
    - with Mu Coils ON, we collected 4 runs: with/without motion, with/without DFC
    - Stimulus: 
        - we used isi.txt, a pre-defined text file that we used for the AirPuff experiment (add ref here). It contains the inter-stimulus-interval times of 500 trials. The average isi time is 496ms


2. Understanding effect of different filters
    - The main changes wrt the experimental setup described in section 1 were:
        - We used a single TAC cell instead of 3 (attached to the right index fingertip) 
        - We used either the ema filter (tau=0.1) or the elliptical filter (cutoff=55Hz, order = 10, rp=0.1)
    
3. Additional measurements:
    - We recorded 2 resting state data at the beginning (NoDFC) and at the end (withDFC) of the session
        - These were 4min long
    - We made an empty room measurement by placind the sensors on Lisa (the foam head model)

4. Importing 4x4 model onto BrainSight:
    - Anna wrote a neat summary on the steps we followed to import the model and can be found on the MEGCore website

    ```{admonition} Issues
    :class: warning
    The 4x4 CAD model and the anatomical data don't share the same coordinate system. The model needs to be rotated

    The reconstructed anatomical image (in scanner space) and the imported CAD model don't share the same coordinate system
