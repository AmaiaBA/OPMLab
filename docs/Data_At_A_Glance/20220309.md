- [DFC + Galileo somatosensory stimulation](../Measurements/20220309.md)
:::

To investigate whether DFC improves the ERF detection after a tactile stimulation with different amount participant motion, we collected 4 runs:
- with DFC + participant still
- with DFC + participant made gentle head motion
- no DFC + participant still
- no DFC + participant made gentle head motion

The following panels show the recorded time course of the primary sensors (magnetometers), the bz compensation that was computed to synthesize the gradiometer response, and the gradiometer response

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
The compensation of sensors 14,15,16 don't look right (especially sensor 16)
```


To compute the next figure, the following preprocessing steps were carried out on mne:
- remove powerline artifact using notch filter at 60 and 120 Hz
- band pass filter the data between 1-110Hz
- no baseline correction was used

Top row: no DFC was applied, thus only magnetometer responses are available
Middle-bottom rows: DFC was applied, thus both magnetometer and 1st order gradiometer responses are available
Left column: participant was allowed to gently move their head; Right column: participant was asked to stay still
x-axis: time wrt to the onset of the stimulus (0s).
y-axis: measured field (fT) 
Each trace represents an opm channel

```
```{admonition} ToDo
:class: note
- there is a delay between the trigger and the stimulus presentation, of about ~35ms
- there is an additional delay caused by sending the command to the usb port, but we have not measured it
```
