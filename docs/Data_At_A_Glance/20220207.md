:name: 20220207_DFCComp_MuCoilsON
	
Effect of using DFC on all primary sensors (red) vs not using DFC at all (blue) when Mu Coils were ON. 
Y axis represents the % signal change on the 27Hz waveform. X axis represent time.
The 4x4 layout represents the sensor layout that was used for the tests. Sensor 14 was not operational. 
```

#### Mu Coils OFF

Effect of using DFC on all primary sensors (red) vs not using DFC at all (blue) when Mu Coils were OFF. 
Y axis represents the % signal change on the 27Hz waveform. X axis represent time.

:height: 650px
:name: 20220207_MuCoilsComp_DFCSomeSens
	
Effect of using DFC on some sensors (subplots marked in blue or red) when Mu Coils were ON (blue) and OFF (red). 
Y axis represents the % signal change on the 27Hz waveform. X axis represent time.
The 4x4 layout represents the sensor layout that was used for the tests. Sensor 14 was not operational.
