:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Fine zero variability test
- GUI and firmware update + gain setting with Tyler
:::

#### Goal: 
- Collect data to understand the variability in the coefficients derived from FieldLine's fine zeroing algorithm
- Update the GUI and the firmware to the latest version

#### Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez


#### Notes:
**Morning:**
- LIQUIFIER OFF, but decontamination happening
- Calibrate Mu coils
- Run Fluxgate test: change the location of the fluxgates

- Re-calibrate the mu coils
- Run fine zero repeat measurements, with NO CALIBRATOR:
    - 1 | all sensors in 4x4 array; 17 repeats (~35min time span between first and last fine zeroing repeat)
        every 1 minute after fine zeroing algorthim was completed (repeats every ~2min)
    - 2 | only sensor 10 in 4x4 array: 15 repeats (~35min time span)
    - These measurements were done while measuring CTF data at the same time. We wanted an additonal measure of how the ambient fields change over time

**Afternoon:**
- liquifier ON
- Calibrate mu coils
- Install latest GUI v1.4.44 and firmware
- Tyler ran the gain setting algorithm

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
Some sensors did not restart properly and could not coarse zero as they were detecting the liquifier signal, so we turned the liquifier off
```
