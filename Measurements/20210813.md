:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration Run with OPMs
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer2cm
:::

#### Goal: 
To run calibration measurement with 37 coils and 16 + 3 opms

#### Experimenters: 
Tom Holroyd and Amaia Benitez

#### Notes:
Input parameters:
- Sine wave generator, input voltage: 2Vpp
- Sine wave generator, frequency of sine wave: 27Hz 
- Duration of measurement: 4 minutes per coil
- 2cm spacer between calibrator and fixture


```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- The calibrator and waveform generator were plugged into a different power strip than the OPMs. This caused strange spikiness in the ADC channel, probably caused by ground bias. 
- Partway through the recording we bumped the power supply for the EdgeRouter and it dropped all the connections, so we had to reboot and restart all the sensors. The ADC was quiet after that, but then after a while it started to get weird spikes.
