:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration runs (coil 0 only) with OPMs
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer1cm
- CTF run (coil 0 only) 5 reps
:::

# Goal:
Understand zeroing-related interactions
Repeatability measurements

# Experimenters:
Stephen Robinson, Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:

**Morning session:**
- corner sensors 5 repetitions,  fine zeroing in between
- all sensors 5 repetitions,  fine zeroing in between
- all sensors but 9 and 10 swapped, fine zeroing in between
- 2 CTF measurements

5 2 minute datasets on the CTF MEG with the ADC enabled
CTF first. 5 repeats, 2Vpp
ADC1 corresponds to the output of the calibrator
ADC2 corresponds to the output of the function generator

**Afternoon session:**
- corner sensors 5 repetitions, no fine zeroing in between
- all sensors 5 repetitions, no fine zeroing in between
- all sensors but 9 and 10 swapped, no fine zeroing in between
- long measurement (10min) with all sensors on
- sensor 10, 5 repetitions, no fine zeroing in between [liquifier was off]
- sensor 10, 5 repetitions, fine zeroing in between [liquifier was off]
- long measurement (10min) wit all sensors on [liquifier off]
- all sensors, with 43Hz sinusoidal wave as input (amplitude remained 2Vpp), 3 repetitions instead of 5, with fine zeroing in between [liquifier off]



:::{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
I encountered problems when trying to record from a single sensor. Even if coarse and fine zeroing worked well, I kept getting the following error when I pressed the record button "System error: missing channel during recording: 00:01.  
Recording stopped". Without power cycling, I tried to turn off the sensors and turn different ones back on sequentially to see if there was a minimum number of sensors that needed to be on to not to get the error. 
It only let me record when all 16 channels were on. Then I power cycled the chassis and selected a single sensor -- and this time it worked. This took about an hour
