:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration runs (coil 0 only) with OPMs
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer1cm
- CTF run (coil 0 only) 5 reps
:::

# Goal:
- Understand zeroing-related interactions
- Repeatability measurements

# Experimenters:
Stephen Robinson, Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez

# Notes:

**Morning session:**
- corner sensors 5 repetitions,  fine zeroing in between
- all sensors 5 repetitions,  fine zeroing in between
- all sensors but 9 and 10 swapped, fine zeroing in between
- CTF measurements:
    - 5x 2 minute datasets on the CTF MEG with the ADC enabled, 2Vpp
    - ADC1 corresponds to the output of the calibrator
    - ADC2 corresponds to the output of the function generator

**Afternoon session:**
- corner sensors 5 repetitions, no fine zeroing in between
- all sensors 5 repetitions, no fine zeroing in between
- all sensors but 9 and 10 swapped, no fine zeroing in between
- long measurement (10min) with all sensors on
- sensor 10, 5 repetitions, no fine zeroing in between [liquifier was off]
- sensor 10, 5 repetitions, fine zeroing in between [liquifier was off]
- long measurement (10min) wit all sensors on [liquifier off]
- all sensors, with 43Hz sinusoidal wave as input (amplitude remained 2Vpp), 3 repetitions instead of 5, with fine zeroing in between [liquifier off]



:::{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
Amaia encountered problems when trying to record from a single sensor. Even if coarse and fine zeroing worked well, she kept getting the following error when she pressed the record button "System error: missing channel during recording: 00:01.  Recording stopped". Without power cycling, she tried to turn off the sensors and turn different ones back on sequentially to see if there was a minimum number of sensors that needed to be on to not to get the error. It only let her record when all 16 channels were on. Then she power cycled the chassis and selected a single sensor -- and this time it worked. This took about an hour
