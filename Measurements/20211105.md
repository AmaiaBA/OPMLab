:::{admonition} Measurement type
OPM data using median nerve stimulation
:::

# Goal:
Collect SEF from the somatosensory cortex during median nerve stimulation 

# Experimenters:
Stephen Robinson, Tom Holroyd

# Pilot participant:
Amaia Benitez

# Notes:

**Grass stimulator setup**
- S1 channel (no train)
- ISI knob: 0.35s
- Pulse duration: 500us
- Pulse amplitude: ~6V (x10)
- Photoelectric stimulus isolation unit params:
    - current range set to maximum
    - polarity: NORM.
    - black and red connectors had resistors

**Subject prep**
- Wear neoprene cap (size?)
- Scrub skin
- Conductive gel
- Electrodes on right wrist (red, positive, towards the hand (distal); black towards the shoulder)

**Inside the MSR**
- Participant sitting down
- Head resting on top of the back of the chair, with a pillow underneath
- Sensor array on left somatosensory cortex, attached with sensor straps on neoprene cap

**Measurement parameters**
- run duration: 400s
- number of runs: 2
- sampling rate: 1000Hz
- fine zeroing in between runs; switching the system on right before the run starts to prevent sensor overheating
