:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration Run with OPMs
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer2cm
:::

#### Goal: 
Collect open loop (OL) and closed loop (CL) data to learn phase shift occurrence for different configurations

#### Experimenters:
Allison Nugent and Amaia Benitez

#### Setup:
- OPMs:
    - Hardware: We used 16 sensors from chassis 2 & 3 sensors (the first 3) from chassis 3
    - Software: FieldLine Recorder v1.4.35
- Airpuff: 
    - Airpuff 2 and 3, attached to the inner face of the fixture
    - Notes: 
        - they need to be connected to separate "adc" channels; airpuff box does not like it when we use a T connector to connect both valves to the same output
        - take cable corresponding to each valve and connect to the adc channel (1-4, but Tom said that 2 does not wokr)
        - on the other side of the room, where the stim computer is, make sure you connect the same channels to the parallel port
        - make sure that the SetAirpuff.py script outputs to the right valves
- Calibrator:
    - The input voltage was 2Vpp except for the outer-most ring (>= coil 19), whose input voltage was 4Vpp 
    - We used a 2 cm spacer 

#### Notes: 
We performed 2 runs:
1. OL calibration
    - with fine zeroing after every measurement >> this was recorded and saved in an excel sheet
    - 2min long, 2-4Vpp, 27Hz
    - Recording time was set to 125s to allow time between start/end of coil activation using the doit program from Tom >> data was then chopped to 120s time series per coil
2. CL calibration
    - with fine zeroing after every coil
    - 2min long, 2-4Vpp, 27Hz
    - Recording time was set to 125s to allow time between start/end of coil activation using the doit program from Tom >> data was then chopped to 120s time series per coil


```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
Performing fine zeroing during OL configuration took a very long time. Fine zeoing during CL did not take as long.
