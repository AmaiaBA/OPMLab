:::{admonition} Measurement type
Calibration Run with OPMs
:::

#### Goal: 
- Update FieldLine firmware to v1.4.36 --> it should have the phase delay between chassis fixed
- Set gains for all 4 chassis

#### Experimenters: 
Tom Holroyd, Stephen Robinson, Amaia Benitez

#### Notes:

- Jeramy and Tyler started working on setting up the CL gain
- First Bode plot showing gains (solid lines) and phase (dotted lines)

Bode after gain calibration.  According to Jeramy, a couple of the sensors did not like the auto-tuned values

Bode after gain calibration, take 2. This time, the spread is high at the beginning

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
After calibration (take 2), chassis 0 shut down unexpectedly and restarting did not help. This happened before Tyler could set the gains, so we stopped the optimization process and chassis 0 was shipped to FieldLine so they could fix it. According to Tyler:
 
 "So it looks like the fan wasn't properly crimped. When I first got the chassis it came on no problem but when I opened it up and oh so gently tugged it turned off. So I'm guess vibrations were enough to knock it loose and fedex's careful handling put it back. I've secured the fan so that won't happen again. We'll run some sensors on it overnight to make sure it doesn't shut off before we send it back."
