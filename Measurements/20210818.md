:::{admonition} Measurement type
Cross-talk
:::

#### Goal: 
- Perform rosstalk measurements of Chassis 0
- Meeting with Tyler from Fieldline to solve issues experienced with GUI the weekend before

#### Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd and Amaia Benitez

#### Notes:
We used FieldLine api v 0.0.9 to modulate the Bz field for each sensor.
Input parameters:

- Chassis id : 0
- Input Amplitude for modulation: 100 nT
- Input Frequency for modulation: 27 Hz
- Duration of modulation: 100s

After the measurement, we met with Tyler from Fieldline. He updated the firmware and software (now v.1.4.35)

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
When looking at the data, the amplitude modulation seemed <<<100nT, so we contacted FieldLine to learn about the discrepancy between the input and measured data
Jeramy said that "with such a large amplitude (100nT) you should expect to be saturating that particular sensor. Think of it as applying an 'external' field and measuring the change internally. Technically both the sine wave and the measurement it is being done with the same coil, but it has the same effect."

    Solution: apply sine wave with amplitude <5 nT
