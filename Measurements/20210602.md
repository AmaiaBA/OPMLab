:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration Run with CTF system
- Truth file to use: truth_CTF_20210602
:::

#### Goal: 
Record calibration data using CTF system to verify coil dipole orientation and test calibration program

#### Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd and Amaia Benitez

#### Setup:

- Calibrator
    - Tom had the excellent idea of using a plastic "bucket" (according to Amazon, it is a  CD DVD Blu-ray Disc CAKE BOX Spindle) on top of the calibrator in order to place the 3 fiducials for head localization
    - Placement: he fiducials are rotated 180 deg wrt the origin of the jig system. The positions of each fiducial were measured with a measuring tape.
