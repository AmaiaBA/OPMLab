:::{admonition} Measurement type 
- Calibration Run with OPMs
- Truth file to use: truth_Spacer2cm
:::

#### Goal: 
Test-retest reliability of calibration data
Does re-zeroing affect the stability of the measurements?
Are field values consistent between sensors (will all sensors always measure a 10fT field as 10fT, or are there systematic differences)

#### Experimenters:
Allison Nugent and Amaia Benitez

#### Setup:
- OPMs:
    - Hardware: We used 16 sensors from chassis 2 & 3 sensors (the first 3) from chassis 3
    - Software: FieldLine Recorder v1.4.35 -- it was updated during this session
- Airpuff: 
    - Airpuff 2 and 3, attached to the inner face of the fixture
    - Notes: 
        - they need to be connected to separate "adc" channels; airpuff box does not like it when we use a T connector to connect both valves to the same output
        - take cable corresponding to each valve and connect to the adc channel (1-4, but Tom said that 2 does not wokr)
        - on the other side of the room, where the stim computer is, make sure you connect the same channels to the parallel port
        - make sure that the SetAirpuff.py script outputs to the right valves
- Calibrator:
    - Tom had swapped the electronics between coils 0-18 and 19-37 days before these measurements
    - Allison put them back to normal order before we started collecting data    


:::{important}
- Calibrator and Function Generator have to be connected to the same power supply
- Coarse and Fine zeroing does not work when the calibrator is on!

#### Notes: 
We ran:
1. 2 empty room recordings: (1) 4min, (2) 2min long
2. Manual calibration: 2min long, 2Vpp, 27Hz
    - WITH Coarse-Fine zero, energize coil 0 (000000_finezero_reset0)
    - WITH Coarse-Fine zero, energize coil 0 (000000_finezero_reset1)
    - WITH Coarse-Fine zero, energize coil 0 (000000_finezero_reset2)
3. Automatized calibration using Tom's 'doit' program in Linux computer: 2min long recording/Coil, 2Vpp, 27Hz (calibratorRun_finezero_reset0)
4. Manual calibration: 2min long, 2Vpp, 27Hz
    - NO Coarse-Fine zero, energize coil 0 (000000_nofinezeroreset0)
    - NO Coarse-Fine zero, energize coil 0 (000000_nofinezeroreset1)
    - NO Coarse-Fine zero, energize coil 0 (000000_nofinezeroreset2)    
5. Automatized calibration using Tom's 'doit' program in Linux computer: 2min long/Coil, 2Vpp, 27Hz (calibratorRun_finezero_reset1)
6. Manual calibration: 2min long, 2Vpp, 27Hz
    - WITH Coarse-Fine zero, energize coil 0 (000000_finezero_reset3)
    - NO Coarse-Fine zero, energize coil 0 (000000_nofinezeroreset3)
    - WITH Coarse-Fine zero, energize coil 0 (000000_finezero_reset4). NOTE!! for this run, the fixture was rotated by 180 deg

#### Fine zeroing algorithm:

- We ran into coarse-fine zeroing problems when the calibrator was on
- Tyler explained that "The calibrator signal is interfering with the zeroing approach because we're attempting to reduce the impact of a step we're applying the signal from the calibrator is larger than the step"
"so on the old system we had a different zero-ing technique. one advantage was that it was less sensitivty to large signals such as this calibrator
disadvntage was that it didn't zero as well/reduce cross axis noise as well. The calibrator signal is interfering with the zero because we're attempting to reduce the impact of a step we're applying the signal from the calibrator is larger than the step. so we're unable to zero"
- In the current version of the fine-zeroing algorithm, they  try to reduce the cross-axis noise
- They lock the z-axis, and adjust the x and y axes
- They try to reduce the impact (of what?) by adjusting Bx and By values
- The calibrator generates a strong signal, which is above the allowed tolerance set in the algorithm.
