:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Calibration Run with CTF system
- Truth file to use: truth_CTF_20211013
:::

#### Goal: 
The data from 06/02 had a bizarre jump in the reference magnetometers we donâ€™t understand (the gradiometer references and the primary sensors [also gradiometers] do not show this behavior)
CTF measurements with higher input voltage (6Vpp): we increased the input amplitude so there's plenty of signal at the magnetometers.

#### Experimenters:
Allison Nugent and Amaia Benitez

#### Setup:

- Calibrator
    - Similar to the 20210602 measurements, we placed a plastic "bucket" (according to Amazon, it is a  CD DVD Blu-ray Disc CAKE BOX Spindle) on top of the calibrator in order to place the 3 fiducials for head localization
    - We kept the same relative placement of the fiducials wrt the previous measurement: the fiducials are rotated 180 deg wrt the origin of the jig system. The exact positions of each fiducial coil may differ wrt the 20210602 measurent, so we measured their location using a measuring tape. We will create a measurement-specific truth file for this data
- Airpuff: 
    - Airpuff 2 and 3, attached to the inner face of the fixture
    - Notes: 
        - they need to be connected to separate "adc" channels; airpuff box does not like it when we use a T connector to connect both valves to the same output
        - take cable corresponding to each valve and connect to the adc channel (1-4, but Tom said that 2 does not work)
        - on the other side of the room, where the stim computer is, make sure to connect the same "adc" channels to the parallel port
        - make sure that the SetAirpuff.py script outputs to the right valves

#### Notes: 
We ran 2 automatic calibration runs: 2 min long/coil; 6Vpp, 27Hz
