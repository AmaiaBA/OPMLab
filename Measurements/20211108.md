:::{admonition} Measurement type
CTF data using median nerve stimulation
:::

# Goal:
Collect SEF from the somatosensory cortex during median nerve stimulation 

# Experimenters:
Allison Nugent, Tom Holroyd

# Pilot participant:
Amaia Benitez

# Notes:

**Grass stimulator setup**
- S1 channel (no train)
- ISI knob: 0.35s
- Pulse duration: 500us
- Pulse amplitude: ~6V (x10)
- Photoelectric stimulus isolation unit params:
    - current range set to maximum
    - polarity: NORM.
    - black and red connectors had resistors

**Subject prep**
- Wear neoprene cap (size?)
- Scrub skin
- Conductive gel
- Electrodes on right wrist (red towards the hand; black towards the shoulder)


**Measurement parameters**
- run duration: 400s
- number of runs: 1
- sampling rate: 2400Hz

**Notes**
- Participant moved 4-5mm according to CTF head localization algorithm

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- We had an issue with the isolation unit: no stimuli could be detected by the participant or experimenters
- Switching the isolation unit solved the issue
