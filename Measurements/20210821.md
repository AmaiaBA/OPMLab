:::{admonition} Measurement type
Cross-talk 
:::

#### Goal: 
- Coss-talk measurements for all 4 chassis
- Test real-time visualization developed by Tom*
    * this GUI allows to visualize all 16 sensors in the chassis at once and helps us to monitor the behavior of sensor 1 at all times (no need to click on it using FieldLine GUI)

#### Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd and Amaia Benitez

#### Notes:

- Chassis id : 0,1,2,3
- Input Amplitude for modulation: 2 nT
- Input Frequency for modulation: 27 Hz
- Duration of modulation: 100s
- No air puff was used

```{admonition} Issues
:class: warning
- The real-time program slowed down the collection of the data, since the data buffer was <<< than the sampling rate. BUT this did not affect the quality of the data
- Sensor 4 of chassis 2 behaved strangely. 

```

(to do: show figure)
