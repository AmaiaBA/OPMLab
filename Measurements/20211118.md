:::{admonition} Measurement type
- Fine zero variability test
- Thermal test
:::

#### Goal: 
- (Morning) Collect repeated zero coefficient measurements in 3 orthogonal directions (x,y,z)
- (Afternoon) Run thermal tests on 4x4 array


#### Experimenters:
Tom Holroyd, Amaia Benitez


#### Notes:
**Morning:**
- We used the reference array and placed sensor 10, chassis 2 in each of the orthogonal slots, one at a time
- We collected 8 repeats in CL and OL, and collected a 4min measurement in CL
- WE ALSO TURNED OFF THE EYE TRACKER, RAN FIELDLINE RECORDER ON BATTERY AND CONNECTED THE ROUTER TO THE SAME POWER SUPPLY AS THE EDEGE ROUTER

**Afternoon**
- We ran 6 thermal tests: 3 on the 4x4 array with AIN fins ON (newest array printed by Katherine) and 3 on the "old" 4x4 array without AIN fins ON
- Measurements were carried out over 30 min
- We measured from one of the center sensor and one of the corner sensor
